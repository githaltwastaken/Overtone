# Timeline

Engineering log for osu! Timing Analyzer: what changed, **why**, and what it measurably did.

Newest first. One entry per release. Each entry keeps the same four sections so a
future reader can skim for the one they need:

- **Changed** — what the release does differently.
- **Fixed** — bugs, with the root cause, not just the symptom.
- **Hardening** — robustness and security work.
- **Measured** — numbers, or "not measured" if there aren't any.

A `Rejected / tried and dropped` section is worth adding whenever an approach was
attempted and abandoned — the reasoning is the expensive part, and re-deriving it
later costs more than writing it down now.

## v3.0 — 2026-09-04 · Least-squares grid engine

The headline change: **BPM is no longer derived from the gaps between beats.**

### Why the old approach capped out

v2 computed tempo as `60 / (t[k+1] - t[k])`, smoothed. Every detected beat carries
a few milliseconds of onset-detector jitter, and differencing two jittery numbers
*amplifies* that noise instead of averaging it away. No amount of median filtering
downstream can recover information the differencing threw out. That is why v2 sat
at ~0.2 BPM of wobble and ~8 ms of offset error no matter how the filters were tuned.

v3 fits an explicit model to the attack times instead:

```
t(k) = offset + k · beat_length        (k = integer beat index)
```

by iteratively re-weighted least squares. With N inlier attacks the fitted period
averages the jitter down by √N. That single change is where essentially all of the
accuracy gain comes from; everything else in this entry exists to make sure the fit
is seeded correctly and applied to the right span of audio.

### Changed

- **Attack detection at sample resolution.** Peaks come off a 2.9 ms onset envelope
  (hop 128, was 256) with parabolic sub-frame interpolation, then each one is
  **re-timed on the raw waveform**: a local energy window walked back to its 20 %
  rise. A spectral-flux peak lags the physical attack by roughly one analysis
  window, which is exactly the ~8 ms bias v2 shipped with. Measured after the fix:
  attacks land 0.15 ms from truth with 0.15 ms spread.
- **Circular-coherence pulse sweep.** `R(f) = |Σ w·e^{2πi f t}| / Σ w` scores a
  candidate pulse rate in one O(N) pass, so the whole plausible range is swept
  rather than trusting one tracker's guess. Candidates are ranked by
  *share* × *coverage* (see Rejected, below).
- **Expanding-window least squares.** The fit grows over the track in doubling
  spans, so a 1 % seed error is absorbed without ever slipping a beat index.
- **Octave from accent depth.** Attacks are grouped by index modulo *m*; if *m*
  atoms really make a beat, one class holds the kicks and another the filler, so
  the spread between strongest and weakest class is large. That plus tempogram
  hints read through librosa's log-normal prior picks the beat — and the downbeat.
- **Sections grow and re-seed.** A region extends forward while attacks keep
  landing on its grid; the next region runs **its own** coherence scan instead of
  inheriting a period that just failed. Boundaries then settle on the beat where
  the two grids cross, and every section is refitted on its own attacks alone.
- **Legacy engine kept as a fallback**, not deleted. Rubato, free time and
  non-percussive audio have no grid to fit; those fall through to the v2 hybrid
  tracker and the analysis says so (`engine: legacy` in `--stats`).
- API: `analyze_audio(..., engine="auto"|"precision"|"legacy")`;
  `force_subdivision` is now a float (`0.25 … 4`, so ÷2 finally exists in the GUI
  and CLI); `osu_timing_text(analysis, decimals=0)`; new `GridSection` dataclass and
  `Analysis.sections / attack_times / attack_weights / engine / fit_residual_ms`.
- Docs: README rewritten around the measured numbers and an explicit
  "Honest limits" section. Tests 35 → 55.

### Fixed

- **Coherence phase came back negated.** `z = Σ w·e^{2πi f t}` has
  `arg(z) = 2π f φ`, so `φ = arg(z)/(2πf)` — the code used `-arg(z)`. Every seed
  grid started in **anti-phase**, half a beat off, and least squares cannot recover
  from a slipped beat index. This was the single largest source of error in the
  first working version of the engine. Regression test:
  `GridMathTests.test_coherence_phase_has_the_right_sign`.
- **`_refine_beats_to_transients` had a latent `NameError`**: `dtype(...)` where
  `dtype=...` was meant, on the empty-input branch. Present since v2.1.
- **Variable-tempo tracks collapsed into one section.** A global expanding fit ran
  *before* section growth, so on a 128 → 142 BPM track it locked onto 142 and the
  per-section seeds inherited that. Removed; each section now seeds itself.
- **Section boundaries landed a beat late.** The reach walk that decides where a
  grid stops explaining attacks used a 5 %-of-beat tolerance, loose enough for the
  *old* grid to claim the *new* tempo's first beat. Now driven by each side's own
  fit residual.
- **Swung and ornamented music pulled the offset late.** Least squares balances
  everything inside its tolerance window, so a second population of attacks (swung
  off-beats, ghost notes) dragged the grid halfway toward them — 17 ms on the
  shuffle fixture. `_recentre_phase` scores candidate shifts with a narrow Gaussian
  and snaps to the *mode* rather than the mean. 17 ms → 0.09 ms.
- **`min_delta` was scaled the wrong way** when handed to the atom-level segmenter
  (`/m` instead of `*m`), making the change detector ~m² more sensitive than the
  documented parameter promised.
- `_robust_local_bpms` raised `IndexError` on arrays of 0 or 1 beats.
- The GUI editor located the edited point with `list.index()`, which matches by
  *value* on a frozen dataclass — duplicate points returned the wrong row.

### Hardening

- **`.osu` injection is now atomic** (temp file + rename). Previously a crash or
  power loss between truncate and write destroyed the user's beatmap.
- **An existing `.bak` is never overwritten.** Injecting twice used to back up the
  already-injected file, losing the pristine original for good.
- **Legacy `.osu` red lines are recognised.** Format v3/v4 wrote only
  `time,beatLength`; the old 8-field check treated those as green, so a legacy map
  kept its old red lines *and* gained the new ones. A negative beat length now
  always means inherited, overriding a contradictory flag.
- **Offsets export as whole milliseconds.** The `.osu` format specifies integers and
  osu!stable does not accept decimals; v2.2 wrote `.3f`. The fit is sub-millisecond,
  so rounding costs at most 0.5 ms. `--decimal-offsets N` opts back in for lazer.
- **A corrupt config no longer bricks the app.** `load_config` returned whatever
  JSON it found; a list or a scalar crashed startup with `AttributeError`, which the
  user could only fix by deleting `~/.timing_analyzer.json` by hand. Now validated,
  size-capped, and written atomically.
- **Resource limits** against absurd or hostile input: audio duration is checked
  from the file *header* before decoding, plus caps on `.osu` size, config size,
  click-track length, coherence-sweep frequencies, and onsets fed to the O(N×M)
  kernel scans.
- Division-by-zero guards for hand-edited 0 BPM points along every export path;
  a cap on the legacy peak-tracker's gap reconstruction loop.
- **The fallback is no longer silent.** An unexpected exception inside the precision
  engine used to degrade quietly to the legacy tracker, which hides a real bug
  behind merely-worse numbers. It now reports the exception type in the progress
  message — and this immediately caught a live regression during development (a
  cleanup pass deleted two helper functions and every benchmark silently dropped
  back to v2-quality output).
- Audited and clean: no `eval`/`exec`/`pickle`/`subprocess`/`shell=True`, no
  user-controlled format strings, no writes outside the target file's own directory.

### Measured

24-track synthetic benchmark with exact ground truth (odd tempos incl. 222.222 and
128.37, added noise, ±8 ms performance jitter, swing and shuffle, drops, sparse
breakdown bars, a 6-minute track, and 2–4 tempo changes per song), scoring **every**
section rather than only the first:

| | v2.2 | v3.0 |
|---|---|---|
| median BPM error | 0.18 BPM | **0.0000 BPM** |
| median offset error | 8.2 ms | **0.14 ms** |
| sections within 0.05 BPM **and** 5 ms | 0 / 24 | **24 / 24** |
| wall time, 60 s track | ~6 s | **~0.8 s** |

The speedup is incidental: the old tempogram ran at hop 128 and cost ~10 s of the
~11 s total. It only ever fed an octave *hint*, which needs no such resolution, so
it now runs on a 4× max-pooled envelope.

Degenerate inputs behave: a 120 → 160 BPM ramp and pad-only audio fall back to the
legacy tracker, pure silence raises a clear `ValueError`, white noise does not hang.

### Rejected / tried and dropped

- **"Slowest strong coherence peak" as the atomic grid.** `R(f)` is high at the true
  pulse *and every multiple of it*, so the fundamental is the slowest strong peak —
  in theory. In practice a 12-second uniform click track has near-flat coherence and
  a grid at half density (share 0.5) still qualified, halving the tempo. Replaced by
  ranking on *share* × *coverage*: a grid twice too slow explains only half the
  attack energy, a grid twice too fast fills only half its own slots, and only the
  true atom scores on both. Requiring `share ≥ 0.72` instead was tried first and
  rejected — it rejects legitimately ornamented music (the shuffle fixture sits at
  0.53) while still admitting the half-density case at 0.559.
- **Least-squares residual cost for section boundaries.** It is *flat* at the true
  change, because at a real tempo change both grids pass through the same beat and
  fit equally well on either side of it. Measured cost differed by 0.9 % between the
  correct split and one a beat early — noise. What *is* sharp is that the two grids
  share a beat there and drift apart linearly away from it, so the boundary is now
  placed at that crossing.

### Open items

- The benchmark harness that produced the numbers above lives outside the repo, so
  the README's table is not currently reproducible by a reader. Folding a trimmed
  version into the test suite (or a `bench/` directory) is the obvious next step.
- **The octave remains a judgement call, and always will be.** A 92 BPM song with
  eighth-note hats is a valid 184 BPM map; 225 BPM streams read as 112.5 to any
  estimator carrying a perceptual prior. `Prefer map BPM (120–300)` breaks the tie
  toward osu!'s range and ×2 / ÷2 is now instant and exact, but no detector settles
  this for you.
- Rubato and non-percussive audio still route to the v2 tracker, which emits a
  staircase of sections. Fitting a slowly-varying tempo curve (rather than piecewise
  constant) would serve those tracks properly.
- Swing and shuffle produce exact BPM and offset but a large grid residual, because
  the off-beats genuinely do not sit on a subdivision. That number is honest, but the
  confidence score currently reads it as instability.

## v2.2 — 2026-09-03 · Editing, injection, hardening

Two commits (`0576894`, `ea5cb6e`).

- **Changed**: manual timing-point editor (add / update / delete / nudge ±1 and
  ±5 ms / per-section ×2 and ÷2); `.osu` injection preserving green lines and CRLF
  style with a `.bak` backup; per-section half-time pulse hints; menu bar i18n.
- **Fixed**: CSV column labels; CLI error paths made to exit cleanly instead of
  raising tracebacks; the GUI worker thread stopped touching Tk variables (it now
  captures parameters before the thread starts).
- **Hardening**: parameter validation before any I/O; validation tests.
- **Measured**: not measured — accuracy work in this release was qualitative.

## v2.1 — 2026-09-03 · Hybrid tracking

Commit `a3bc82e`.

- **Changed**: hybrid beat tracking (librosa DP + PLP + peak-picking fallback, most
  clock-regular candidate wins); sub-frame parabolic transient re-anchoring;
  half/double-time resolved from onset evidence at subdivided grid positions rather
  than blind multiplication; defaults retuned for songs that change tempo often;
  English as the default UI language.
- **Fixed**: half-time locks collapsing a whole map into one "constant" section
  (225 vs 222.2 differ by only ~1.4 BPM once halved, below `min_delta`).
- **Measured**: not measured — no ground-truth harness existed yet, which is
  precisely why the v2 error floor went unnoticed until v3.

## v1 — 2026-09-03 · Initial release

Commit `fae9bf7`. Onset-strength envelope, `librosa.beat.beat_track`, tempo from
smoothed beat intervals, persistence-based segmentation, Tk GUI, CSV and `.osu`
text export.

## Resumen en español

Este archivo es el registro de ingeniería del proyecto: qué cambió, **por qué**, y
qué efecto medible tuvo. Entradas de más nueva a más vieja, una por versión, cada
una con las mismas cuatro secciones (Changed / Fixed / Hardening / Measured) más,
cuando aplica, `Rejected` — las ideas que se probaron y se descartaron, porque el
razonamiento es lo caro de reconstruir después.

El cambio central de v3.0: el BPM ya no sale de las diferencias entre beats
consecutivos, sino de un ajuste por mínimos cuadrados sobre los tiempos de ataque.
Error mediano 0,0000 BPM y 0,14 ms frente a 0,18 BPM y 8,2 ms en v2.2, y unas 7
veces más rápido. Lo que sigue sin resolverse — y no lo resuelve ninguna
herramienta — está en `Open items`.
